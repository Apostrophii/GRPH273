What is the thing that jumps out at you the most (good or bad)?
Lots of gray and such. Also that shadow at the top.

What is something you would change, and how would you change it?
I would add arrows at the bottom.

What is the best thing about this design?
I personally like the gray asthetic and that it's a bit different. Could easily get boring though.

On a scale of 1â€“10 (1 being almost none, 10 being lots), how much effor do you think went into this design?
8
