What is the thing that jumps out at you the most (good or bad)?
Lot's of underlines.

What is something you would change, and how would you change it?
Too much underlining I'm thinking. How about not on the urls maybe? Well I guess this is just an issue on the mobile site, but still.

What is the best thing about this design?
I like the rounded black look, it feels very modern.

On a scale of 1â€“10 (1 being almost none, 10 being lots), how much effor do you think went into this design?
7
